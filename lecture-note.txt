This is how it's going to be
Service D will have it's own database and other service whenever some create or update happens, emit an event 
which this service will take and then perform operation in it's own database, so when this Service D has to provide
information it can directly look into it's own database
Problem is paying extra for storage + extra database
Harder to understand
what if something fail
- extremly fast
- Service D has every thing in it's own database
- Data duplication
- we are not recording entire document, but still it's data duplication
- we are going to focus on this request
- other services will wait on it
